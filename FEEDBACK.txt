FEEDBACK:

Excellent implementation of stack data structure, especially in using 
    object oriented design to extend your generic LinkedList class.
    

Good testing of your implementation. You're very close.
	Make sure to always verify your results or post a question if you are unsure.
	
	
—1 class StackList is missing displaying required field "name", which makes it difficult to 
     identify the stack you are displaying. 
     See sample output in project description. 
     For future, if the description is unclear, please post a question on discussion forum.
     
     Next time minus two for this.


-0.5 incomplete implementation of class Navigator goForward() method does not
   successfully set the backLinks stack.
   See sample output below.

   Suggestion: Try the adding a few links to your browser’s forward links stack.
               Then, go to a new page. What happens?
